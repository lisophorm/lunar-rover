Open SpecRunner.html in a browser and with reference to the unit tests in script.spec.js, spend no more than 1-2 hours writing JavaScript (plain, or pick your favourite framework) to get the tests to pass.

It's pretty open-ended, there's no particular 'correct' way to do this, and what (if any) UI elements you introduce is up to you. Don't worry if you don't finish within the time allowed - the focus is on showing some breadth of knowledge, and to talk through your coding/design decisions during the interview.
